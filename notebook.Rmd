Set up CI with GitHub Actions. 


### Jan 17

Stayed up way too late trying to figure out valid ways to query the API. Found and read documentation. 


### Jan 19

Lots of setup today. I created a whole bunch of files (ie. `code_of_conduct.md`, `contributions_workflow.md`, `LISENCE`, etc.) and organized the repo. Read tutorials on how to make a package in R. I also started working on the `README.md` file. Talked with the group about branches and merge conflicts.
